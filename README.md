Mapbox don't provides it's autocomplete API.But still we can develop it using mapbox's reverse geocoding api.
I personally prefer mapboxAPI as it is free to use and it's apiKey can be obtained without providing bank account details.
So it is better than googleMapsApi for those we don't want to share their bank details .
